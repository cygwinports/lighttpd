ldesc: "Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility -- all of these 
describe lighttpd which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver; 
as it is designed and optimized for high performance environments. With 
a small memory footprint compared to other web-servers, effective 
management of the cpu-load, and advanced feature set, lighttpd is the 
perfect solution for every server that is suffering load problems."
